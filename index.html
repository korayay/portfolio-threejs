        <h2>🌮 Work History</h2>

        <h3>DECATHLON</h3>
        <h5>Sales Consultant</h5>
        <p>
          I worked in the consulting team for 1 month as a sales consultant to see what experience working with a team would be like.
        </p>
        <h3>DOGUS TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <h5>Software Development Intern</h5>
        <p>
          I worked as a Front End Developer in the Application Management Team for my first 5 months. Taking part in the system infrastructure team also enabled me to learn about the parts of a site from its birth. Later, I moved to the Software Team and supported the projects again as A FrontEnd Developer. In both processes, I worked based on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.JS and very little React.JS.
